Here we measure the fraction of formulas that get recovered exactly. We assume that the formula is recovered exactly if mse between parameters (coefficients and powers) is less than 1e-4. We use formulas with 2, 3 and 4 variables, with different types of power selection (random between 1 and 6, random between 1 and 12 divided by 2, random between 1 and 72 divided by 12), and with different number of samples (10, 100, 1000). Each .pkl file contains recovery rate for 5 experiments for each described configuration. New formula and new dataset are generated in each experiment. We want to obtain 95% confidence intervals of length no more than 0.1 so we make 375 experiments. Each .pkl file is generated within an hour, so the whole process took about 77 hours.
